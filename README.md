# UA-TOOLS-Translations

Thank you for taking the time to help!

To submit a translation simply clone this repo and copy the english folder and then rename to the language you are working with. Make the changes and then create a PR.

Please make sure to run a syntax check before submitting
```
plutil -lint /path/to/Localizable.strings
```
